# How to Test the New Changes

## The Problem

You're seeing OLD console logs:
```
No organization found, setting error  ❌ OLD CODE
```

You should see NEW logs:
```
No organization selected - will show selector  ✅ NEW CODE
```

## Solution: Force Dev Server to Use New Code

### Method 1: Stop and Restart Dev Server

1. **In your terminal where dev server is running:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it
   - Wait for it to fully stop

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **In your browser:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Or open a NEW incognito/private window

### Method 2: Clear Everything (If Method 1 Doesn't Work)

1. **Stop dev server** (Ctrl+C)

2. **Clear Vite cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   ```

3. **Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **In browser:**
   - Clear all cache
   - Or use incognito/private window
   - Visit: `http://87.106.199.5:5173`

## How to Know It's Working

### Old Logs (Wrong - means you have old code cached):
```
Current organization result: null
No organization found, setting error  ❌
Organization error or not found: Organization not found null
```

### New Logs (Correct - new code is running):
```
Current organization result: null
No organization selected - will show selector  ✅
```

And you should see the **Organization Selector page** instead of an error!

## Test URLs

Once dev server is restarted:

### 1. Organization Selector (no org parameter)
```
http://87.106.199.5:5173
```
**Expected:**
- "Select Organization" page
- Two buttons: "System Administration" and "Demo Organization"

### 2. Super Admin (with ?org=admin)
```
http://87.106.199.5:5173?org=admin
```
**Expected:**
- Super Admin login page
- Blue theme
- Email and password fields

### 3. Demo Organization (with ?org=demo)
```
http://87.106.199.5:5173?org=demo
```
**Expected:**
- Demo Organization login page
- Green theme
- Email and password fields
- "Switch Organization" button at bottom

## The Slash Issue

You mentioned: `http://87.106.199.5:5173/?org=admin`

**This is COMPLETELY NORMAL!**

Both of these URLs work exactly the same:
- `http://87.106.199.5:5173?org=admin` ✅
- `http://87.106.199.5:5173/?org=admin` ✅

The browser automatically adds the `/` - this is standard behavior and not a problem!

## Quick Checklist

Before testing:
- [ ] Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Check console for NEW logs ("No organization selected - will show selector")
- [ ] See organization selector page (not error page)

## Still Having Issues?

If you STILL see "No organization found, setting error":

### Check Which File Is Being Served

In browser console, type:
```javascript
console.log(window.location.href)
```

Then look at the network tab:
- The JS bundle should be: `index-CUkgbHn0.js` (from latest build)
- If you see: `index-eDEKvupk.js` - that's OLD code!

### Force Browser to Get New Code

1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache" checkbox
4. Keep dev tools open
5. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

### Nuclear Option: Clear EVERYTHING

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear all caches
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf dist

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

Then in browser:
- Open new incognito/private window
- Visit: `http://87.106.199.5:5173`

## What Changed in the Code

The fix was in `src/hooks/useTenant.ts` line 26-32:

**OLD:**
```typescript
if (!org) {
  console.log('No organization found, setting error')  // ❌
  setError('Organization not found')  // ❌ This broke it!
}
```

**NEW:**
```typescript
if (org) {
  console.log('Organization found:', org.name)
  setOrganization(org)
} else {
  console.log('No organization selected - will show selector')  // ✅
  setOrganization(null)  // ✅ No error, just null
}
```

The key difference: We DON'T set an error when no org is selected - that's the expected state for showing the selector!

## Success Looks Like This

When it's working, you'll see:

**Console:**
```
Current hostname: 87.106.199.5
Hostname parts: ['87', '106', '199', '5']
Development mode (localhost/IP), no org param - showing selector
Loading organization...
Checking if super admin subdomain for hostname: 87.106.199.5
Development mode (localhost/IP), is admin: false
Getting current organization...
Current organization result: null
No organization selected - will show selector  ✅ THIS LINE!
```

**Screen:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Select Organization              │
│  Choose your organization to sign in    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🏢 System Administration               │
│     @admin                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🏢 Demo Organization                   │
│     @demo                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Good luck! The code is definitely fixed - it's just a matter of getting the browser to use the new version! 🚀
