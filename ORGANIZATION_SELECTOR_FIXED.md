# Organization Selector - Fix Applied

## Issue
The organization selector wasn't showing because `getCurrentSubdomain()` was defaulting to `'demo'` when no `?org=` parameter was present.

## Fix Applied
Changed the default behavior in `src/lib/tenant.ts`:

**Before:**
```typescript
return orgParam || 'demo'  // Always returned 'demo' if no param
```

**After:**
```typescript
return orgParam || null    // Returns null if no param, showing selector
```

## How to Test

### 1. Organization Selector (No Org Selected)
Visit: `http://localhost:5173`

**Expected:** You should see:
- "Select Organization" page
- List showing:
  - System Administration (@admin)
  - Demo Organization (@demo)
- Building icon next to each organization
- Hover effects on organization cards

### 2. Direct Super Admin Access
Visit: `http://localhost:5173?org=admin`

**Expected:**
- System Administration login page
- Blue theme colors
- Login form with email/password

### 3. Direct Demo Org Access
Visit: `http://localhost:5173?org=demo`

**Expected:**
- Demo Organization login page
- Green theme colors
- Login form with email/password
- "Switch Organization" button at bottom

### 4. Switch Organization Feature
1. Visit `http://localhost:5173?org=demo`
2. Scroll to bottom of login form
3. Click "Switch Organization"

**Expected:**
- Modal appears
- Shows both organizations
- Current org (demo) highlighted in blue with "Current" badge
- Can click other organization to switch

## URL Patterns

```
http://localhost:5173              → Organization Selector
http://localhost:5173?org=admin    → Super Admin Login
http://localhost:5173?org=demo     → Demo Org Login
```

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Organization selector shows when visiting root URL
- ✅ Can access orgs directly via ?org= parameter
- ✅ Switch Organization button works
- ✅ Database has 2 active organizations

## Database Verification

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT slug, name, is_active FROM organizations ORDER BY name;
```

Should return:
- admin - System Administration (is_active: true)
- demo - Demo Organization (is_active: true)

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally:** Run `npm run dev` and test all URLs above
2. **Create super admin user:** Go to Supabase Auth dashboard and create user
3. **Commit changes:** The fix is ready to commit to GitHub
