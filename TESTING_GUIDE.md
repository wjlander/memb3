# Complete Testing Guide - Organization Selector & Super Admin

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Organization Selector Not Showing
**Problem:** LoginForm wasn't checking the `loading` state from `useTenant` hook
**Fix:** Added loading state check and loading screen

### Issue 2: Default Organization
**Problem:** System defaulted to 'demo' when no ?org= parameter
**Fix:** Changed to return `null` so selector appears

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/tenant.ts** - Line 48: Changed `return orgParam || 'demo'` to `return orgParam || null`
2. **src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx** - Added loading state check

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Organization Selector Shows (Root URL)

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit:** `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Brief "Loading..." screen
   - Then "Select Organization" page appears
   - Shows 2 organizations:
     - **System Administration** (@admin) - Blue building icon
     - **Demo Organization** (@demo) - Blue building icon
   - Hover effects work (blue border on hover)

4. **If you see:** Login form instead of selector
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check for errors
   - Look for console logs showing what tenant detected

### Test 2: Direct Super Admin Access

1. **Visit:** `http://localhost:5173?org=admin`

2. **Expected Result:**
   - Brief "Loading..." screen
   - System Administration login page
   - Blue color theme (#1E40AF)
   - Email and password fields
   - "Sign In" button
   - NO "Switch Organization" button (only shows if 2+ orgs)

3. **Try logging in:**
   - If super admin created: Should log in
   - If not created: Will show error

### Test 3: Demo Organization Access

1. **Visit:** `http://localhost:5173?org=demo`

2. **Expected Result:**
   - Demo Organization login page
   - Green color theme (#059669)
   - Email and password fields
   - "Switch Organization" button at bottom

### Test 4: Switch Organization Feature

1. **Visit:** `http://localhost:5173?org=demo`
2. **Scroll to bottom** of login form
3. **Click:** "Switch Organization" button

4. **Expected Result:**
   - Modal appears with dark overlay
   - Shows both organizations
   - "Demo Organization" highlighted with blue background
   - Shows "Current" badge next to demo
   - Can click admin to switch
   - "Cancel" button at bottom

5. **Click "System Administration"**
   - Should redirect to `?org=admin`
   - Page reloads with admin login page

### Test 5: Browser Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) and check for these logs:

```
Loading organization...
Current hostname: localhost
Hostname parts: ["localhost"]
Development mode, org param: null
No subdomain detected
No organization found, setting error
```

This confirms the selector logic is working.

## Database Verification

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

### Check Organizations
```sql
SELECT slug, name, is_active FROM organizations ORDER BY name;
```

**Expected:**
- admin | System Administration | true
- demo | Demo Organization | true

### Check Super Admin Profile
```sql
SELECT
    p.email,
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name,
    p.role,
    o.slug as org
FROM profiles p
JOIN organizations o ON p.organization_id = o.id
WHERE p.role = 'super_admin';
```

**Expected:**
- Shows your super admin user with role='super_admin' and org='admin'
- If empty: You need to create the super admin (see CREATE_SUPER_ADMIN.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still seeing login form instead of selector

**Solution 1:** Clear browser cache
```bash
# In browser, press Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete
# Clear "Cached images and files"
# Or use incognito/private window
```

**Solution 2:** Hard refresh
```bash
# Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+R
# Mac: Cmd+Shift+R
```

**Solution 3:** Check the URL
- Make sure you're visiting `http://localhost:5173` (no ?org= parameter)
- Not `http://localhost:5173?org=demo`

### Problem: "Loading organizations..." never goes away

This means the organizations aren't loading from the database.

**Check:**
1. Supabase connection in `.env` file is correct
2. Organizations exist in database (run SQL query above)
3. Browser console for network errors

### Problem: Organizations show but clicking doesn't work

**Check browser console for:**
- JavaScript errors
- Failed navigation
- URL should change to include `?org=admin` or `?org=demo`

### Problem: Can't create super admin - foreign key error

**This means:**
- User doesn't exist in auth.users table
- Organization doesn't exist in organizations table

**Fix:**
1. Create user in Supabase Auth Dashboard FIRST
2. Then run the profile INSERT query

### Problem: Super admin login shows "Invalid credentials"

**Check:**
1. User exists in Auth dashboard
2. User is confirmed (not pending)
3. Password is correct
4. Profile exists with role='super_admin'

## URL Reference

```
http://localhost:5173                  → Organization Selector
http://localhost:5173?org=admin        → Super Admin Login
http://localhost:5173?org=demo         → Demo Org Login
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Organization selector appears when visiting root URL
✅ Can click organizations to navigate
✅ URL changes to include ?org= parameter
✅ Login page appears with correct organization theme
✅ Switch Organization button works
✅ Modal shows all organizations
✅ Super admin user can log in at ?org=admin

## Next Steps After Testing

1. ✅ Confirm organization selector works
2. ✅ Create super admin user (see CREATE_SUPER_ADMIN.md)
3. ✅ Test super admin login
4. ✅ Build super admin dashboard
5. ✅ Add organization management features

## Development Tips

### Quick Test Command
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Open browser to test URLs
open http://localhost:5173
open http://localhost:5173?org=admin
open http://localhost:5173?org=demo
```

### Console Log Debugging

Add this to LoginForm to see what's happening:

```javascript
console.log('LoginForm state:', {
  organization,
  subdomain,
  tenantLoading,
  showOrgSelector,
  organizationsCount: organizations.length
})
```

This will show you exactly what the component sees.
